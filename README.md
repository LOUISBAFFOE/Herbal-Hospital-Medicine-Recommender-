So this app in relation to a site is basically a herbal medicine recommender for a hospital.
Based on the ability of this app to generate recommendation of drugs with respect to the kind of symptoms of a particular disease at hand.
With the help of statistical modules, this app has adapted to the ability to recommend effective drugs based on the production such drug within the hospital.


#I would really be glad if anyone could help implement more steps and amicable procedures to help make this app become one of a kind.
